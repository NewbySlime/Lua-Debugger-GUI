# Security Policy

This section will talk about what to do when you found a vulnerability in the project.

## Supported Versions

You can report on any version, as long as you don't find a duplicate of the same issue, or don't find a resolved issue.

We recommend reporting on a newer version as that can help us find the root of the cause efficiently, therefore, we will be thankful if you can find and report a vulnerability that occur in the previous versions on a newer version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To reporting a vulnerability, you can privately report it in ***Security -> Advisories -> Create a new draft***.
We will put the issue as top priority, so that it will be fixed as soon as possible.

When the issue had been fixed, we will announce it in ***Discussion*** tab.
